## The power of open science *(template for you to play with)*

here is a link to [something else] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet). 
###It is the ##cheat #sheet

These [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CsoBX3LwU8r5_34nuzthO9bn8xLxZMmL6-uY-yUaRTs/edit?usp=sharing) are from a 60-minute guest lecture about open science, the Ocean Health Index, and Openscapes. The audience was Professor Claudia Tyler's Conservation Ecology EEMB 168 course at UCSB on March 7, 2019.

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

I also talked about GitHub for science â€“ and can include an image with the same format, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()` (From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url).
