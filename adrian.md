# The power of open science *(template for you to play with)*

I don't have anything to share EXCEPT OUR **NEW SCIENCE PAPER THAT I CAN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT IT** - http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/eaav1004.abstract

We talk about whales some, which is fun:

You can contact me *(lists need a carriage return before list items)*:

Here is a table with some collaborators *(tables use `|`s and `-`s to separate columns and rows)*:


Name | Twitter | GitHub
-----|---------|--------
Jamie | [@jafflerbach](https://twitter.com/jafflerbach) | [@jafflerbach](https://github.com/jafflerbach)
Melanie |  | [@Melsteroni](https://github.com/Melsteroni)

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

I also talked about GitHub for science â€“ and can include an image with the same format, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()` (From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url).
