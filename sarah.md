Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

I also talked about GitHub for science â€“ and can include an image with the same format, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()` (From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url).
